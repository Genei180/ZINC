# DON’T RUIN THIS FOR EVERYONE.
Like any toy blaster this one, depending on its appearance & presentation, has the
potential to be mistaken for a real firearm. This blaster must be printed in bright colors
and used responsibly so that it cannot under ANY circumstances be misconstrued for
a deadly weapon. If you fail to build & use this blaster with this in mind you will
jeopardize not only your own life, but also the future of this hobby.

## Naming of Parts
![](assets/Part_Names.png)

### Calibration
Start by Printing the [Plunger](#Plunger) (& [Plunger-Core](#Plunger-Core), if you have no Metall one)
If those Fit fine inside each other it should work fine.

### Plunger
![](assets/Plunger.png)
- 2 variations, high & low power.
- 0.15mm layer height
- No supports
- 6 perimeters
- If you can’t thread the aluminum/3D Printed
plunger core into the printed part
you need to recalibrate your
printer

### Plunger-Core
![](assets/Plunger_Core.png)
- 2 variations, high & low power.
- 0.15mm layer height
- Add Support
- 100 % Infill

This Orientation is Required, for Strength, else the Plunger Core will Breake more Easily under Tension.

### Frame
![](assets/Frame.png)
- 0.2mm Layer Height
- 6 Perimeters
- 5 Top, 5 Bottom
- 100% infill is ideal
- NO SUPPORT
- NO BRIM (Use one if absolutely necessary but
understand it will require careful clean up with an
Exacto knife)
- Ensure excellent bed adhesion, lift from the bed will
ruin the part. Use an adhesive if necessary
- PETG or PLA+
- Avoid “elephants foot”. If it is present you will need to
clean up the rails with an Exacto knife.

### Slide
![](assets/Slide.png)
- 0.2mm Layer Height
