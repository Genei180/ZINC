## Tools Needed
- Silikon Oil (Lubing)
- Thread Cutting Set (for Plunger Rod)
- Drill Bits (Recutting Holes)
- Metal Saw (Cutting Barrel and Chamfer too Size)
- Pliers (cant Hurt too have them)

## Materials
### 3D Print Materials
- PLA (+) Filament
- Alternative (PETG)

### 3D Printed Parts
- See [Parts](ZINC_Files/Current/) for Parts you need too Print [^MetricInfo]

If you are using this BOM you need the _Metric Parts.

### Hardware
- Plunger Tube (28mm OD, ~~25mm~~ 24mm ID, Length 152mm) See: [^MetricInfo]
- Barrel (16mm OD, 13mm ID, Length 133mm, Chamfer one side)

- Plunger Rod (M3) 3mm OD, Length 186mm
- Metal Plunger Core (can be Printed) (CNC Pull Stud) (BT30-90W)

- M2 (2mm) Pins
	- 10mm (Plug for Magazin Eject)
	- 2x 28mm (Holds Sear & Guard)
- M4 (4mm) Pin 
	- 10mm (Plug for Magazin Eject)

- M3 Screws
	- 1x 8mm (Holds the Cover)
	- 4x 12mm (Holds Front, Rear)

- 4x M3 Nut
- 2x M3 Spacer Disk

- Thumb Nut (M3)
- 2x Magnets (6mm OD, 6mm Height)

- O- Rings
	- 5mm Dia x 2mm Thickness (Plunger Impact Dampener)
	- 8mm Dia x 2mm Thickness (Chamber Seal)
	- 18mm Dia x 2.5mm Thickness (Plunger Seal)
	- 18mm Dia x 2mm Thickness (Rear Seal)

\* OD = Outer Diameter <br>
\* ID = Inner Diameter

[^MetricInfo]: If you are Buying the Hardware Kit Ignore the _Metric Parts.
	If you want too Source Metric Hardware yourself, the Tube would have the approximate Size 28mm OD, 25mm ID.
	It seems difficult to Obtain an Acrylic Tube with 1.5mm Wall Thickness. Most Common Options have 2mm Wall Thickness.
	Therfore when 3D Printing Parts with this BOM the _Metric Variant has been Adapted for this Case. 

### Springs
- Trigger Spring (Wire Dia 1mm, OD 19mm, Length 20mm)
- Main Spring (wire dia 2mm, OD 24mm, will need to cut this to 131mm length)
- Mag / Ladder  Spring
- Sear / Torsion Spring (6 laps 120degrees, 0.4 wire dia, 4mm outer diamter)

The following Springs can be obtained by cannibalizing ballpoint pens
- Mag Release Spring (wire Dia 0.4, outer Dia 4mm, length 50mm)
- 2x Catch Spring (wire Dia 0.4, outer Dia 4mm, length 25mm)(Half one Ballpoint Pen Spring)
- Eject Spring (wire Dia 0.4, outer Dia 4mm, length 50mm)

#### Spring Manufacturing:
If you want to Manufacture your own, you additionally need the Following Spring Wire Diameters
- Wire 1mm
- Wire 2mm
- Wire 0.4mm

**Compression Springs**
Main Spring:
- OD 23mm, 2mm Wire Dia, 130mm Length
